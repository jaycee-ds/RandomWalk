# RandomWalk
A Python script to run two functions which generate a random walk and plot it. Code lines commented for further understanding of each step.

## What is a Random Walk?

A Random Walk is just a sequence of values which start at a certain point (0 in this case) and choose between two possible values in every single step (1 or -1) so that it generates a line from the origin to the end when you plot it. Try it out!
